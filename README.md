# ðŸ›’ Jenson USA â€“ SQL Analytics Project

# Project Overview

This project simulates the role of a Data Analyst at Jenson USA, where the goal is to extract actionable insights from retail data using SQL. The analysis covers customer behavior, staff performance, inventory management, and store operations, helping leadership make data-driven decisions to improve sales, optimize inventory, and enhance staff productivity.

The dataset consists of multiple relational tables that capture orders, customers, products, categories, staff, and stores, enabling a holistic view of operations.

# Store Performance

## Q1. Find the total number of products sold by each store along with the store name.

Total reimbursed for inpatient claims, grouped by provider

```sql

select * from stores;

select * from orders;

select * from order_items; 

SELECT 
    s.store_id, s.store_name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS products_sold
FROM
    stores s
        JOIN
    orders o ON o.store_id = s.store_id
        JOIN
    order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY 1 , 2;

```

# Product Trends

## Q2. Calculate the cumulative sum of quantities sold for each product over time.

```sql

select * from order_items;

join order_items oi
on p.product_id = oi.product_id
join orders o
on o.order_id = oi.order_id;


# Method - 2
